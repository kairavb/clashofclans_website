<p>Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which players build a community (in the form of a clan), train troops, and attack other players to earn gold, elixir and Dark Elixir. There are four currencies or resources in the game. Gold and elixir can be used to build and reload defenses that protect the player from other players' attacks. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells. Gems are the premium currency. Attacks are rated on a three star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.</p>

The game also features a pseudo-single player campaign in which the player can attack a series of fortified goblin villages and earn gold and elixir.<font color="pink"><p> The game has 2 'builders' by default, but the player can install more builders (maximum 5) by buying them at an increasing number of gems. Builders are important for upgrading any building. If all builders are busy upgrading a building, one has to either wait (if the player wants to upgrade a different building) for them to be free or complete another building's upgrade using gems.</p>
